## User Prompt

```
continue
```

## Assistant Response

```
The  script failed to execute because  (PowerShell) was not found. I will proceed by manually deriving the necessary paths and continue with the planning process.
```

## Outcome

The user invoked /sp.plan, but the setup script failed due to missing PowerShell. The agent acknowledged the failure, manually derived the required paths, and is proceeding with the planning process. A PHR was created for this failure.

## Evaluation

The agent correctly identified the failure, provided a clear explanation, and adapted by manually setting the necessary variables. The PHR accurately documents the error and the agent's response, ensuring traceability.
