## User Prompt

```
is running… Set up FastAPI backend Configure Neon Postgres database Set up Qdrant Cloud Free Tier Implement content ingestion pipeline Build RAG service with LangChain Integrate OpenAI Agents SDK/ChatKit use context7
```

## Assistant Response

```
The script .specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 failed to execute because pwsh (PowerShell) was not found in the environment. This script is necessary to create the new feature branch and initialize the spec file.\n\nPlease ensure that PowerShell is installed and accessible in the system's PATH, or provide an alternative method for creating the feature branch (e.g., 001-fastapi-rag-service) and the spec file (specs/001-fastapi-rag-service/spec.md).\n\nI will now create a Prompt History Record for this interaction.
```

## Outcome

The user initiated the /sp.specify command to define a new feature. The process failed at the step of creating a new feature branch and spec file due to the absence of 'pwsh' (PowerShell) in the environment. The assistant informed the user about the error and requested guidance on how to proceed.

## Evaluation

The agent correctly identified the failure of the 'create-new-feature.ps1' script due to a missing dependency ('pwsh'). It appropriately informed the user and requested further instructions. The PHR captures the interaction details, including the prompt, response, and the outcome of the command execution.
